# APM - Application Portfolio Management

To execute this application you must create a mongoDB database, and get its connection link.
The link must be included in a ".env" file as a variable named "MONGODB_URL".

This is a simple APM web application that is able to control the current state and end state of applications used by each business process of a company.
The applications can be hierarchically divided by projects, business capabilities, and locations.

The application is still on early stages. It lacks some functionalities and some bugs were not addressed.
